200g digestive biscuits
75g butter, melted
600g full-fat soft cheese
250g golden caster sugar
150g tub natural yogurt
3 medium eggs
finely grated zest 2 lemons, juice of 1
50g plain flour
200g raspberries
icing sugar, to decorate

1. Heat oven to 120C/100C fan/gas and line the base of a 20cm round springform tin
with greaseproof paper. Crush the biscuits in a food processor or in a food bag
using a rolling pin. Tip into a bowl with the melted butter and mix well. 
Push the biscuits into an even layer into the base of the cake tin and chill 
until needed.

2. In a separate bowl use an electric whisk to beat the soft cheese with the 
sugar. Next beat in the yoghurt then the eggs one at a time. Finally beat in 
the lemon zest, lemon juice and flour. Fold through two thirds of the 
raspberries crushing them very slightly so they start to bleed into the mix 
then tip the mix on top of the biscuit base and smooth over the top. Bake for 
45 mins then turn off the oven, leave the cake inside for another hour then 
cool at room temperature. Chill overnight. To serve, remove from tin, scatter 
with remaining raspberries and dust heavily with icing sugar.
